# Minotaur
Minotaur is a C# OpenGL game development framework, I created after Microsoft abandoned [XNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_XNA).

This repository contains two projects with the main library in [minotaur](https://github.com/mlunnay/minotaur/tree/master/minotaur). This includes both the runtime library and a content pipeline library for transforming graphics, model and other resources into fast loading format for the runtime library.

The second project is a collection of [tests](https://github.com/mlunnay/minotaur/tree/master/minotaur-tests) for various aspects of the framework. Of note is [MinotaurTests.Common](https://github.com/mlunnay/minotaur/tree/master/minotaur-tests/MinotaurTests.Common) wich contains some common extenions and an implementation of an [Imidiate Mode GUI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immediate_mode_GUI).
