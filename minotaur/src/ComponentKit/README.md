# ComponentKit

This here kit is useful if you need to model something like this:

	------------------------------------------------------------------------
	|          | Position | Health | Flying | Fire Breathing | Combustible |
	------------------------------------------------------------------------
	| "Player" |    x     |   X    |        |                |      x      |
	| "Dragon" |    x     |   X    |   x    |       x        |             |
	------------------------------------------------------------------------
	     ^                             ^
	  Unique entities      composed of arbitrary behaviors.


## Usage

Defining entities is easy:

```C#
Entity.Define("Player",
    typeof(Health),
    typeof(Combustible));

Entity.Define("Dragon",
    typeof(Health),
    typeof(FireBreathing));
```

And creating instances of them works like so:

```C#
IEntityRecord player =
    Entity.CreateFromDefinition(
        "Player", "You!");

IEntityRecord dragon =
    Entity.CreateFromDefinition(
        "Dragon", "A Firebreathing dragon!");
```

When you want to manage and handle specific components separately, you set triggers. Like this:

```C#
List<Combustible> combustibles = 
    new List<Combustible>();

EntityRegistry.Current.SetTrigger(
    component => component is Combustible,
    (sender, eventArgs) => {
        foreach (IComponent component in eventArgs.Components) {
            Combustible combustible = component as Combustible;
            
            if (combustible != null) {
                if (combustible.IsOutOfSync) {
                    combustibles.Remove(combustible);
                } else {
                    combustibles.Add(combustible);
                }
            }
        }
    });
```

But don't forget to commit the changes. Otherwise the triggers **will not** be run:

```C#
EntityRegistry.Current.Synchronize();
```

### Components

They come in 2 shapes:

 - **Component**: Basic component that can be attached to any entity. Can provide behavior or just data.
 - **DependencyComponent**: Like the Component, but can specify a dependence on other components.

A very basic component could look like this:

```C#
class Health : Component {
    public Health() {
        Amount = 100;
    }

    public bool IsDead {
        get {
            return Amount <= 0;
        }
    }

    public int Amount { 
        get; 
        set; 
    }
}
```

Some components need to interact with others, take this one for example:

```C#
class Combustible : DependencyComponent {
    [RequireComponent]
    Health _health;

    public bool IsBurning { 
        get; 
        private set; 
    }

    public void Combust() {
        IsBurning = true;
    }

    public void Extinguish() {
        IsBurning = false;
    }

    public void Burn() {
        _health.Amount -= 10;
    }
}
```

Common for all components is that they have to be handled by you. The firebreathing dragon does not breathe fire until it is told to. Usually this is handled through a trigger or similar system.

```C#
class FireBreathing : DependencyComponent {
    public void Breathe(IEntityRecord target) {
        if (target.HasComponent<Combustible>()) {
            target.GetComponent<Combustible>().Combust();
        }
    }
}
```

### More

When you're ready to make stuff happen, you go like this:

```C#
dragon.GetComponent<FireBreathing>()
    .Breathe(player);
```

You could even put some real action in:

```C#
Random r = new Random();

for (int turn = 0; turn < 10; turn++) {
    foreach (Combustible combustible in combustibles) {
        if (combustible.IsBurning) {
            combustible.Burn();
        }
    }

    Combustible fire = player.GetComponent<Combustible>();
    Health condition = player.GetComponent<Health>();

    if (fire.IsBurning) {
        // There's a 10% chance that the player figures out how to extinguish himself!
        bool playerStoppedDroppedAndRolled =
            r.Next(0, 100) <= 10;

        if (playerStoppedDroppedAndRolled) {
            fire.Extinguish();
        }
    }

    if (condition.IsDead) {
    	// Unfortunately for the player, he did not figure it out in time.
        break;
    }
}
```
